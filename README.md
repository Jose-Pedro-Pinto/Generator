# Generator
Examples of synthetic data generator usage.

This repository contains several eamples of how to use the developed synthetic data generator.
Basic functionalities include tabular data generation and time series generation.
A more advanced machine learning imputation-based generator component is also present.
This component takes as an input real data samples to train and uses a combination of sub-sampling and imputation.

The source code of the generator is proprietary and thus is not and will not be made available.
This repository serves simply as a demonstration of usage and functionalities.
Given this, the provided notebooks should not be run, as such would remove the output.
Further use cases and examples may be provided in a case by case basis upon request.
